\subsection*{Sluggishness and defensiveness enabled an executive order on research integrity}

Here~\cite{thorp25-06}, Science responds to a speech by Director Kratsios at the National Academy of Sciences about the scientific ``Gold Standard''~\cite{kratsios25-05}.

Kratsios comments on the change in the scientific landscape, for example the shift towards industry-funded research.
With this, they are re-evaluating how funded research should be conducted.
\begin{itemize}
    \item It should be targeted, attached to specific prizes and objectives
    \item It should have high standards of scientific conduct
\end{itemize}
They describe this Gold Standard Science as being
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reproducible and transparent
    \item Proactively communicate errors and uncertainties
    \item Collaborative and interdisciplinary
    \item Suspicion of blind consensus and a celebration of informed dissent
    \item Meritocracy, (no DEI programs)
\end{itemize}
