                poorly-connected to disconnected clusters. We present simple
                modifications to improve the connectivity of SBM clusters, and
                show that the modifications improve accuracy using simulated LFR

    abstract = {Community detection methods help reveal the meso-scale structure
                of complex networks. Integral to detecting communities is the
                expectation that communities in a network are edge-dense and
                “well-connected”. Surprisingly, we find that five different
                community detection methods–the Leiden algorithm optimizing the
                Constant Potts Model, the Leiden algorithm optimizing modularity,
                Infomap, Markov Cluster (MCL), and Iterative k-core
                (IKC)–identify communities that fail even a mild requirement for
                well-connectedness. To address this issue, we have developed the
                Connectivity Modifier (CM), which iteratively removes small edge
                cuts and re-clusters until communities are well-connected
                according to a user-specified criterion. We tested CM on
                real-world networks ranging in size from approximately 35,000 to
                75,000,000 nodes. Post-processing of the output of community
                detection methods by CM resulted in a reduction in node coverage.
                Results on synthetic networks show that the CM algorithm
                generally maintains or improves accuracy in recovering true
                communities. This study underscores the importance of network
                clusterability–the fraction of a network that exhibits community
                structure–and the need for more models of community structure
                where networks contain nodes that are not assigned to
                communities. In summary, we address well-connectedness as an
                important aspect of clustering and present a scalable open-source
                tool for well-connected clusters.},

    abstract = "Community detection is often used to understand the structure of
                large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms
                for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain
                algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that
                largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield
                arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case,
                communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the
                algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe
                that up to 25{\%} of the communities are badly connected and up
                to 16{\%} are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce
                the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields
                communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we
                prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it
                converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities
                are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast
                local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the
                Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden
                algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find
                that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm
                and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit
                guarantees.",

    abstract = {The minimum cut problem for an undirected edge-weighted graph
                asks us to divide its set of nodes into two blocks while
                minimizing the weight sum of the cut edges. Here, we introduce a
                linear-time algorithm to compute near-minimum cuts. Our algorithm
                is based on cluster contraction using label propagation and
                Padberg and Rinaldi’s contraction heuristics [SIAM Review, 1991].
                We give both sequential and shared-memory parallel
                implementations of our algorithm. Extensive experiments on both
                real-world and generated instances show that our algorithm finds
                the optimal cut on nearly all instances significantly faster than
                other state-of-the-art exact algorithms, and our error rate is
                lower than that of other heuristic algorithms. In addition, our
                parallel algorithm runs a factor 7.5\texttimes{} faster on
                average when using 32 threads. To further speed up computations,
                we also give a version of our algorithm that performs random edge
                contractions as preprocessing. This version achieves a lower
                running time and better parallel scalability at the expense of a
                higher error rate.},
